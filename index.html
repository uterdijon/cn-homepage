            <!-- ########### TODO ########### -->
            <p>Hi, I'm a 36-year old global nomad born in the U.S. I studied linguistics and foreign languages at university, then I spent about 10 years teaching languages in the U.S., South Korea, India, Madagascar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Germany. After that, I went back to school to learn about historic preservation. I would like to set up a workshop to restore old furniture as a hobby. My wife and I are hoping to move to Spain this year and we are expecting our first child in December. So I am looking to get into a career field where I can do telecommuting/remote work and it made a lot of sense to me to try to get into coding because it is a field with lots of demand and I like learning languages, so I see this as adding to my language repertoire. Also, I like building things, so I see coding as a way to combine the interests in language and building.   </p>

        <h1>Why learn programming?</h1>
        <!-- ########### TODO ########### -->
        <p>I answered this question above, but I will explain why I chose this course. I started learning HTML on Codecademy, then I decided to do another course on there to learn a full programming langauge. I started with Python, because I thought it would useful to know for jobs in natural language processing, which I thought might be a direction for me based on my background in languages. So I took the course in Python and really enjoyed it. Then I took the Java course and realised that it has much more of a learning curve than Python. I decided it would make sense to become proficient in one language before branching out to others. So I decided to stick with Python. I did a lot of searches for bootcamps and there were very few that taught Python. Coding Nomads seemed like the best value and had great reviews so I decided to take the plunge and sign up.</p>
